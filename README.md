# Accelerating Video Convolution Filtering Application
The tutorial introduces the user with a compute intensive application. The specific applications is accelerated using Xilinx Alveo Data Center Acceleration Card. The tutorial will go through the design of specific kernel ( customized hardware implementation of application part chosen for acceleration) that runs on FPGA and host side application optimized. The kernel is designed to maximize throughput and host application is optimized to feed data that moves in-between host and FGPA card.
