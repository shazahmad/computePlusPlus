Building the 2-D convolutional Kernel 
During this lab we will build fully integrated accelerator for video processing. The kernel will be built and integrated with a PICe based Xilinx hardware platform for U200 Alveo Data Center acceleration card.
Lab 3: ( Hardware software integration xclbin and first version of host)

    Create host code for accelerator
    Run hardware and software emulation
    Building xclbin
    Conclude tutorial with Single Cu per RGB channel
    Discuss timing waveform and perform other analysis deemed fit
    Show the performance with respect to software
    Highlight potential gaps/under utilized resources that can be used to increase acceleration
