Lab 2:  ( Using bottom up flow design a kernel, estimate its performance)

    Synthesizing software like kernel vs. Optimized kernel
    Coding the kernel
    Post synthesis analysis and other vitis_hls features that can be useful for bottom up flow
    >>Simulating the kernel if possible 
    Discuss harware optimization applicable to kernel.
    Compare kernel based on line-buffer vs. simple buffer
